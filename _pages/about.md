Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Pittsburgh and a practicing child and adolescent psychiatrist. My research centers on developing novel computational methods that leverage both clinical expertise and methodological rigor. I tend to pursue highly unconventional directions, exploring questions and techniques that are rarely addressed in the field, with the goal of generating foundational discoveries with real clinical impact.

Recent Inventions & Discoveries
======
- **Oxytocin enhances social-emotional reciprocity in autism** [[paper](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.20.25331870v1)]: We uncovered subtle, robust effects of oxytocin on social-emotional reciprocity -- addressing a long-standing challenge in the field, where conventional total scores and subscores have repeatedly failed to detect consistent benefits.
- **Causal inference with latent confounding via time-limited treatment effects** [[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16629)]: We demonstrate that the transient nature of certain treatments enables robust causal inference, even in the presence of latent confounders.
- **Differentiating bupropion and mirtazapine from other antidepressants** [[paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032725009930)]: We identified consistent, clinically meaningful differential effects of bupropion and mirtazapine, addressing a long-standing problem in psychiatry where randomized controlled trials have failed to distinguish these medications despite clear clinical differences.
