Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Pittsburgh and a practicing child and adolescent psychiatrist. My research centers on developing novel computational methods that leverage both clinical expertise and methodological rigor. I tend to pursue highly unconventional directions, exploring questions and techniques that are rarely addressed in the field, with the goal of generating foundational discoveries with real clinical impact.

Recent Inventions & Discoveries
======
- Oxytocin enhances social-emotional reciprocity in autism [paper](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.20.25331870v1): an application of the recently SCORE algorithm identifies subtle effects of oxytocin overlooked by total scores and subscores
- We can leverage the time-limited effects of treatment to perform causal inference even with latent confounding [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16629)
- Bupropion and mirtazapine are consistently differentiable from other antidepressants [paper][https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16629](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032725009930): an application of Supervised Variamax identifies consistent differential effects of bupropion and mirtazapine from other antidepressants.
