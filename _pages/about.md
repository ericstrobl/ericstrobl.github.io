Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Pittsburgh and a practicing child and adolescent psychiatrist. My research centers on developing novel computational methods that leverage both clinical expertise and methodological rigor. I tend to pursue highly unconventional directions, exploring questions and techniques that are rarely addressed in the field, with the goal of generating foundational discoveries with real clinical impact.
